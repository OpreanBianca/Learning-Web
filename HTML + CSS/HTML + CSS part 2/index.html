The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, deep-chested body, 
short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger 
than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult 
males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex 
and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, the species typically does not.
Typically, the lion inhabits grasslands and savannas, but is absent in dense forests. It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, 
but when persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. During the Neolithic period, the lion ranged throughout Africa, 
Southeast Europe, the Caucasus, and Western and South Asia, but it has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one 
population in western India. It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries have 
declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the 
decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern.
One of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, the lion has been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings, 
on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. Lions have been kept in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire and 
have been a key species sought for exhibition in zoological gardens across the world since the late 18th century. Cultural depictions 
of lions were prominent in Ancient Egypt, and depictions have occurred in virtually all ancient and medieval cultures in the lion's historic 
and current range.
